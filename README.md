# dumpUrlandJS
A quick script I wrote for myself to automate the process of Fetching URLs and JS files from the given hosts.

## This script uses tools like:-
- [gau](https://github.com/lc/gau)
- [waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls)
- [subjs](https://github.com/lc/subjs)
- [getJS](https://github.com/003random/getJS)

## Usage:
Examples:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/iamnihal/dumpUrlandJS
$ chmod +x dumpUrlJS
$ ./dumpUrlandJS
```
# Note
Make sure you already have those four tools in your $PATH.
